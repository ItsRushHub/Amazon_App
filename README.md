# Amazon_App

For this activity, I created an Amazon storefront (bAmazon Store). The app takes orders from customers of the products you  have in the store's inventory. When the app starts the inventory data comes up. It asks you, "What is the ID of the product you would like to buy?" and after that "How many units would you like to buy?". It returns the data and ask if you would like to purchase something else. You would hit "y" for yes and "n" for no. If you hit "y" if will ask you again for the "ID" product number. If you hit "n" it will let you know that your order has been filled.
